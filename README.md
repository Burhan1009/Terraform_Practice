The AWS CLI is a command-line tool to interact with AWS services.  

#### **Steps**:
1. **Download AWS CLI**:  
   - Go to the [AWS CLI official website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html).  
   - Download the MSI installer for Windows.

   - Double-click the downloaded MSI file.  
   - Follow the installation wizard to complete the process.  

3. **Verify Installation**:  
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type:  
     ```bash
     aws --version
     ```
   - It should display the installed version of the AWS CLI.

### **Optional: Configure AWS CLI**
1. **Set Up AWS CLI**:  
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:  
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```
   - Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, Region, and output format when prompted.  

2. **Test AWS CLI**:  
   - Run a simple command to verify connectivity:  
     ```bash
     aws s3 ls
     ```
   - This lists the S3 buckets in your AWS account if configured correctly.
